# SoccerAnalysis
An F# Soccer Library that provides soccer analysis and helper functions for a set of information that is available in many different formats. So I created Yet Another Format :smile:

Joe has managed to keep a list of available soccer data [here](http://www.jokecamp.com/blog/guide-to-football-and-soccer-data-and-apis/), but I want to be able take full advantage of F# types system and create set of libraries that will help currate and create a standard for soccer information.
